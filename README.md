# CarbonChain

*Objective*: Incentivize people in developing nations to preserve and expand carbon-sinking forests.

*Problem*: Currently there isnâ€™t a way to transparently and safely transfer money to developing countries and guarantee that natural carbon sinks i.e. forests will be preserved. A number of the problems are listed below:
* How do I trust that the money is going to preserve a carbon-sinking forest?
* How do I trust that the landowners are actually preserving their forest?

The solution to this involves creating a level of trust and partnership between purchaser of the carbon credit and landowner who controls a forest. This is the role of CarbonChain.
